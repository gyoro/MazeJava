MazeJava
========

This Java applet/GUI application uses Java's swing libraries to display to the user a randomly generated maze. The user can walk through the maze using the arrow keys. All parts of the maze are accessible through a single route. This property is ensured through the use of a Disjoint Set or Union/Find algorithm.
